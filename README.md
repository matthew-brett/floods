    > I operate my own weather station in Selly Park which has yielded the
    > following data: Rainfall during the day on 06.09.2008 was 46.0mm. The
    > previous day it was 34.0mm. In the previous 6 days it was 86.6mm. For
    > comparison in a flood in 2007 which did not affect properties, rainfall
    > on 14.06.2007 was 91.5mm. Rainfall the previous day was only 11.8mm and
    > over the previous 13 days was only 4.3m. A few weeks later, rainfall on
    > 20.07.2007 was 55.0mm. The previous day it was only 6.0mm. In the
    > previous 5 days it was only 22.8mm. Again, properties were not flooded.
